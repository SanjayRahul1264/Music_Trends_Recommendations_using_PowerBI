# Music Trends Recommendations using Indian Spotify Data-A PowerBI Project

**OVERVIEW:**

  This project is a Music Streaming Data Analytics Dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the platform's content library, artist performance, and listening trends. Utilizing data visualization (BI) tools, it translates complex streaming metrics—including track popularity, catalog growth, and genre distribution—into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard supports strategic decision-making in content acquisition, marketing spend optimization, and artist/repertoire (A&R) focus areas.

**DATA COLLECTION:**
 
  The dataset was retrieved using the Spotify API, ensuring authenticity and up-to-date information. The songs span across different regions and genres, including Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, Sandalwood, Mollywood, Punjabi, and English music.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanuprakashchegondi/spotify-india-music

**FIELDS**

•	Track ID: The unique identifier assigned to each track by Spotify.

•	Track Name: The title of the song. 

•	Artist(s): The performer(s) of the track.

•	Album: The album or single in which the song was released.

•	Release Date: The date when the track was officially released.

•	Cover Image: A link to the album artwork of the track.

•	Popularity: A score (0-100) representing the popularity of the track on Spotify, based on streaming numbers and engagement.

•	Genre: The genre of the track (Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, Sandalwood, Mollywood, Punjabi, or English).

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
The music platform lacks a unified, data-driven framework for rapidly assessing portfolio health and identifying high-value opportunities. Specifically, the business needed to answer:

Which genres and artists drive the highest listener popularity (engagement and retention) versus simply having the largest catalog size?

Is the high volume of new content acquisition leading to sustained listener interest, or is the platform overly reliant on its legacy library?

How can we forecast peak engagement periods (e.g., June/July) to optimize marketing spend and content release schedules for maximum impact?

**BUSINESS REQUIREMENT**
Spotify stakeholders (music analysts, playlist managers, and marketing teams) need a consolidated dashboard to monitor song and artist performance across different dimensions.

**OUTCOMES**

**Prioritize Indian Content for Mass Appeal:** The popularity and library depth are overwhelmingly driven by Bollywood, Punjabi, and Kollywood. Future content acquisition, marketing, and feature promotion (playlists, recommendations) should continue to heavily focus on these genres, especially around the major composers (Yuvan Shankar Raja, Pritam, Ilaiyaraaja).
Capitalize on the Peak Season: Since popularity peaks in June/July, content release strategies, advertising campaigns, and platform events should be strategically timed to maximize engagement during this period.

**Balance Classic vs. Current:** The platform is successfully balancing a deep, enduring catalog of classics (e.g., Ilaiyaraaja, 1970s/80s Kollywood) with a high volume of new releases (68% in 2024, international albums in "Last 12 Months"). The strategy should be to use the classic library for foundational retention and the high volume of new releases for continuous, daily engagement and acquisition.

**Promote Emerging International Artists:** The presence of new international artists in "Recent Works" and "Album Works" shows a diversification effort. To build on this, the platform needs a clear strategy to push these artists beyond their low track counts/initial buzz and potentially integrate them more effectively with the highly engaged local audience.

**Focus on Hit Potential:** Artists with low track counts but high popularity (e.g., Aastha Gill) are indicators of successful single releases. The platform should analyze the characteristics of these "hit" tracks to inform future signing and promotion strategies.
